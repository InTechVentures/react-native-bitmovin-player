## Project Setup

+ Add in your pod file:
  + `source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'`
  + `pod 'BitmovinPlayer', '2.57.1'`

+   Add your Bitmovin player license key to the `Info.plist` file as `BitmovinPlayerLicenseKey`.

    When you do not do this, you'll get a license error when starting the application which contains the player.

    Your player license key can be found when logging in into [https://dashboard.bitmovin.com](https://dashboard.bitmovin.com) and navigating to `Player -> Licenses`.


+ Optional: You can add a custom CSS and JS in `Info.plist`

    + Key to the `Info.plist` file as `BitmovinPlayerCss`.

    + Key to the `Info.plist` file as `BitmovinPlayerJs`.
